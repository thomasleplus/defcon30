Hello! I'm [@hamster](https://twitter.com/hamster) and I was honored this year to be able to make a couple of SAOs for defcon. I tried to make these simple and fun, and I hope you enjoy them.

The first one is the [SAO Modem 1.69bis](modem), which is a throwback to the days of the external Courier modem screaming away at the internet. It does not actually communicate with the internet, but it sure is blinky.

The second one is [SAO Jack](jack), a simple learn to solder kit with the spirit of defcon in the artwork.

I hope you enjoy, and let [me](https://twitter.com/hamster) know what you think!
